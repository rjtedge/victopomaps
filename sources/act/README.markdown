ACT Map Layers
==============

This directory contains map layers specific to the Australian Capital Territory. Currently, only an additional aerial imagery layer is available; obtain topographic layers from [NSW sources](../nsw).

## 2012 & 2015 Aerial Imagery

A territory-wide, high-resolution aerial imagery layer is available from an ACT government server. The default resolution is 1.0 metres per pixel. Include `act/aerial-2012` and/or `act/aerial-2015` to obtain the aerial image for your map.
