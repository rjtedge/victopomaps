SA Map Layers
=============

This directory contains map layers specific to South Australia.

## Topographic

This preliminary topographic map is derived from SA government servers, however the feature set is very incomplete. Include `sa\topographic` to create these layers.

## Reserves

Include the `sa/reserves` layer to add boundaries and labels for national parks, recreation parks, conservation parks & reserves, regional reserves and wilderness protection areas. The boundaries of Arkaroola and the Woomera Prohibited Area are also included/
